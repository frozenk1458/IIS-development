For now, we configured a simple welcome page with two links (don't work yet) : one will serve for authentication and the other for registration purpose.

The page is accessible via a simple windows authentication (use your login and password to enter into your windows desktop).

The current objectives are :

- Think about create authentication page. If I'll do that I allow people adding users without previous checking (security reason). 
- Manage the authentication via Active Directory (with registration form for user).
